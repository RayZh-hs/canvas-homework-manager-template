# Mango Template Development Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information for developing Mango templates, which are special types of Mango submodules designed to scaffold new Mango repositories. Delete it when you distribute your template.

## Overview

A Mango template is a special type of Mango submodule that replaces the target repository's `.mango` folder with its own when installed. Templates are designed to be:

1. One-time setup tools - Used at repository initialization to provide starting structure
2. Easily version managed - They must be git repositories for updating and sharing
3. Self-replacing - They replace the outer `.mango` folder instead of being nested

## Creating a Template

To create a new template, use the following command:

```bash
mango @init --template template
```

## Template Basics

### Template Structure

```
[project-root]
├── .git
├── .mango
│   ├── .instructions
│   ├── .on-install
|   └── (place your scripts here)
├── .gitignore
├── Development.md
├── README.md
└── (other project files like LICENSE, etc.)
```

This is the basic structure of a Mango template. When your template is installed, its `.mango` folder will replace the target repository's `.mango` folder, and the `.on-install` script will be executed.

- `.mango/.instructions`: Makes the directory a valid Mango folder (can be empty)
- `.mango/.on-install`: Script that runs when the template is installed (handles folder replacement)
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file for the template
- `README.md`: Documentation for the template
- `Development.md`: Detailed development guide, remove if not needed

### The .on-add Hook

When the builtin command `mango @add` is used to create a new script, the `.on-add` hook is executed (if present) to scaffold the new script. It receives the following environment variables:

- `MANGO_REPO_PATH`: path to the directory containing .mango
- `MANGO_SCRIPT_PATH`: full path to the script being created
- `MANGO_SCRIPT_NAME`: name of the script being created
- `MANGO_BINDINGS`: space-separated list of bindings added to the script

### The .on-install Hook

The `.on-install` hook is executed when the template is installed. It receives the following environment variables:

- `MANGO_REPO_PATH`: Path to the directory containing .mango
- `MANGO_SUBMODULE_NAME`: Name of the template being installed
- `MANGO_SUBMODULE_PATH`: Full path to the template being installed to
- `MANGO`: Set to indicate that the script is being run by mango

A typical `.on-install` script should replace the target's `.mango` folder with the template's `.mango` folder:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source_path=$(dirname "$0")
target_path="${MANGO_REPO_PATH}/.mango"
tmp_name=$(echo "$source_path" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Replace target with source
rm -rf "/tmp/$tmp_name" && mv -f "$source_path" "/tmp/$tmp_name"
rm -rf "$target_path" && mv -f "/tmp/$tmp_name" "$target_path"

# Additional setup (git init, config files, etc.)
git init
touch .gitignore
```

### Working with Mango Commands

Working with templates is the same as working with regular Mango repos. You are free to utilize mango commands you registered, including builtin commands like `@list` or `@add`. To add a script, run:

```bash
mango @add your-script-name (--bind bindings)
```

And edit it in your preferred text editor.

## Best Practices

The following best practices are recommended when developing Mango templates:
- Do not remove the git directory. Only templates that are git repositories can be updated and shared.
- Keep all your code inside the `.mango/` folder. Use directories to organize your code as needed.
- Include comprehensive setup in the `.on-install` script (git init, configuration files, initial structure).
- Provide clear documentation in README.md about what the template creates and how to use it.
